# SFM-Toy-Controller

A tool to connect SecretFlasherManaka with Intiface Central, allowing for real-time control of supported toys.

This application listens for in-game events sent by the [SFMToyWebsocket](https://github.com/Henry1887/SFMToyWebsocket) BepInEx plugin (created by Henry1887) and controls devices connected to Intiface.

This tool has been tested and works with the OSR2 and The Handy.  
Vibration support is also included, but since I don't have a vibe device, it's currently untested. If you try it, please let me know if it works!

## Features
+ Real-time Game Integration: Automatically controls piston and vibration functions based on in-game events.

+ Detailed GUI Settings: Finely adjust piston speed, stroke range, and vibration strength through an intuitive user interface.

+ Persistent Settings: Your adjustments are automatically saved to config.json and will be loaded the next time you start the app.

+ Automatic Device Scanning: Automatically detects and lists devices connected to Intiface.
